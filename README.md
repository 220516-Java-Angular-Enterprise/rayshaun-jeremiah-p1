## Overview

<p>
The Employee Reimbursement System (ERS) manages the process of reimbursing employees for expenses related to<br />
food, lodging, travel or other professional development, such as University Courses, Certifications, and Technical<br />
Trainings. All employees in the company can create an account and login. Once authenticated they can submit requests<br />
for reimbursement. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests for all employees in the company<br />
and are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.
